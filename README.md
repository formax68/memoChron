# MemoChron

MemoChron is an Obsidian plugin that bridges the gap between personal knowledge management and time management.
It showcases a list of your calendar events. When you click on an event, it creates a note for this event.

## Installation

1. Open Obsidian Settings

4. Install the plugin and enable it

## Usage

### Adding Calendar Sources

MemoChron supports both remote calendar URLs and local ICS files.

#### Remote Calendars
1. Go to Settings > MemoChron
2. Click "Add Calendar"
3. Enter your public iCalendar (ICS) URL (e.g., `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/...`)
4. Give your calendar a name and optional tags
5. Enable/disable calendars as needed

#### Local ICS Files
You can also use ICS files stored in your Obsidian vault or local file system:

1. Go to Settings > MemoChron
2. Click "Add Calendar"
3. Use one of these methods to specify your local file:
   - **File Picker**: Click the folder icon (üìÅ) to browse and select ICS files from your vault
   - **Vault Path**: Type a relative path like `calendars/work.ics`
   - **Absolute Path**: Use full paths like `/Users/username/calendar.ics` or `C:\Users\username\calendar.ics`
   - **File URL**: Use `file:///` URLs like `file:///Users/username/calendar.ics`
4. Give your calendar a name and optional tags
5. Enable/disable calendars as needed

**Note**: Local ICS files are read-only. To update events, you'll need to export a new ICS file from your calendar application and replace the existing file.

### Viewing Your Calendar

- The calendar will appear in the right sidebar by default
- Navigate between months using the arrows
- Click on any day to see the agenda for that day
- Hover over events to see more details

### Available Commands

- **Force refresh calendars**: Manually refresh all calendar data
- **Go to today**: Navigate to the current month and select today's date
- **Toggle calendar visibility**: Show/hide the month calendar grid (agenda-only mode)

### Creating Notes from Events

1. Click on any event in the calendar or agenda view
2. A new note will be created automatically using your template
3. The note will include event details like title, time, description, and location

### Customizing Templates

In the plugin settings, you can customize:

- Note location in your vault
- Note title format
- Default template with variables like:
  - {{event_title}}
  - {{date}}
  - {{date-iso}} - The event date in YYYY-MM-DD format, regardless of the "Note date format" setting.
  - {{start_time}}
  - {{end_time}}
  - {{description}}
  - {{location}}
  - {{source}}

## Configuration

### Settings

- **Calendar Sources**: Add, remove, or toggle calendars
- **First Day of the Week**: Choose which day the calendar week starts on
- **Hide Calendar**: Show only the agenda view without the month calendar grid
- **Refresh Interval**: Set how often calendar data updates
- **Note Location**: Set the default folder for event notes
- **Note Title Format**: Customize how note titles are generated
- **Template**: Customize the default note template
- **Tags**: Set default tags for event notes

## Current Limitations

- Remote calendars must be publicly accessible (no authentication support)
- No bi-directional sync (changes in notes don't update calendar events)
- Basic calendar views (monthly with agenda)
- Local ICS files are not automatically watched for changes (use manual refresh)
